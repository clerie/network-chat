# network-chat
A lightweight PHP Local Area Netwok Chat

The abition is to have a bulletin board for a small LAN party with friends. Everyone can post messages to a chat, beside a static information box.

It has not the intention to be secure, because it is for your LAN.

Currently the source is a mixture of german and english, sorry for that.
